It's programmable money! This talk will introduce the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and and then demonstrate how Rubyists can interact with its peer-to-peer network, broadcast transactions, and even use its blockchain as a data store.</p> <p><b>About the Presenter</b><br/>Dave Hoover started learning Ruby in 2002, and using it in earnest in 2005 when Rails hit the scene. Dave was a partner at Obtiva, a Chicago-based, Ruby-focused dev shop that was acquired by Groupon in 2011. While at Obtiva, Dave used Ruby to build the first version of<a href=\"http://madmimi.com/\">madmimi.com</a>, as well as making some early contributions at Groupon. He published Apprenticeship Patterns in 2010, a guide for people wanting to improve themselves as software developers. In 2012, Dave joined Dev Bootcamp, and founded the Chicago location in 2013. Nowadays, Dave has returned to his roots, and is a freelance software developer. He mainly works from his family's home in Wheaton. In December 2015, Dave caught Bitcoin fever.</p> <p><br/><b>After most downtown meetings</b> we head over to Elephant &amp; Castle (185 N. Wabash) for refreshments &amp; fellowship.
